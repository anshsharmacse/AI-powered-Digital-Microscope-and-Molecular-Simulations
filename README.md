## Project Description

A unified platform integrating AI-based molecular simulation and digital microscopy to analyze and predict molecular properties with high accuracy and visualize molecular structures in 2D and 3D.

---

## Core Module: Molecular Simulation with Graph Neural Networks

### Input  
- Enter any biological molecule name (e.g., benzene, aspirin)

### Data Source  
- Retrieves molecular data in real-time from PubChem (no local datasets required)

### Core Technology  
- Utilizes a custom Message Passing Neural Network (MPNN) to predict molecular properties

### Graph Representation  
- Molecules are treated as graphs:  
  - Atoms = Nodes  
  - Bonds = Edges  

---

## Key Features

- No local datasets – uses live PubChem API  
- Predicts:
  - Molecular weight  
  - LogP (lipophilicity)  
  - Polar surface area  
- Performs conformer analysis to determine low-energy 3D structures  
- Interactive 2D and 3D visualizations using:
  - RDKit  
  - py3Dmol  
- Shows predicted vs actual properties with error metrics  
- Learns structure-property relationships through GNN training  
- Visualizes molecules from multiple angles and conformers  

---

## Benefits

- Accessible to both beginners and experts in computational chemistry  
- No specialized tools or datasets needed  
- Fully step-by-step organized and commented Python code  
- Enhances learning of molecular AI modeling, chemistry, and bioinformatics
